machine learning algorithms:
-------------------------------------
Machine learning algorithms are essentially sets of instructions that allow computers to learn from data, make predictions, and improve their performance over time without being explicitly programmed. 
Machine learning algorithms are broadly categorized into three types:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1).Supervised Learning: Algorithms learn from labeled data, where the input-output relationship 
2).Unsupervised Learning: Algorithms work with unlabeled data to identify patterns or groupings.
3).Reinforcement Learning: Algorithms learn by interacting with an environment and receiving feedback in the form of rewards 

1).Supervised Learning:
1.Regression:1.linear regression,2.decision tree algorithm
-------------------------
1. Linear Regression:
-------------------------
Linear regression is used to predict a continuous value by finding the best-fit straight line between input (independent variable) and output (dependent variable)

1.Minimizes the difference between actual values and predicted values using a method called “least squares” to to best fit the data.
2.Predicting a person’s weight based on their height or predicting house prices based on size.
classification:
---------------
1.logistic regression,2.svm,
2. Logistic Regression:
--------------------------
1.Logistic regression predicts probabilities and assigns data points to binary classes (e.g., spam or not spam).
2.It uses a logistic function (S-shaped curve) to model the relationship between input features and class probabilities.
Used for classification tasks (binary or multi-class).
Outputs probabilities to classify data into categories.
Example : Predicting whether a customer will buy a product online (yes/no) or diagnosing if a person has a disease (sick/not sick).

2)unsupervised learning:
1.clustering,
2.association analysis
